<h1>This is our neighbour galaxy but this is million of light years away and one really important fact 1 Light year is 9.46 trillion KM away so this galaxy is around 9.4607E+18 km away it would take us 4 billion years to reach this galaxy

<h1>Beyond our Solar System is interstellar medium and more stars along with their star systems. Interstellar medium is the vacuum of space between different star systems, although the space is not actually an empty vacuum. It has dust and other particles in it in addition to cosmic rays and magnetic fields. </h1>
